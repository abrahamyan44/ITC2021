# GCD

The program is designed to calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers. \
The program will ganarate random numbers in the *files/test.txt* when it works.\
Then calculates the greatest common divisor of these numbers by two different \ algorithms /*files/output.txt  files.goutput.txt*/ and check for differences. \
You can find the test results in *files/result.txt.* \ 
In *src/diff.cpp* there is a comment code. \
It is a more optimal version, that we are still working on. \

The following instructions can be used to build the program. \

- 'make clean'                    to delete previously created files.
- 'make  _or_  make release'      to build the  program  in an optimal way.
- 'make debug'                    this is necessary for debugging.
