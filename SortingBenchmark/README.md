```

- You can run the program on tap "./bin/benchmark" and pass two argument. 
```
$./bin/benchmark <arg1> <arg2>
```

- First argument contains length of the array which should be sorted.

- Second argument contains tests count which should be run on the same data (limited to 3).

- You can enter "make clean" for deleting all generated files and directories.
```
$make clean
```

## _Target algorithms:_
* Quick sort
* Shell sort
* Heap sort
* Merge sort
* Selection sort
* Insertion sort
